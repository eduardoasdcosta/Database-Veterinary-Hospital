# Database-Veterinary-Hospital
Information Systems and Databases - Projects

These assignments concern the development of an information system database that supports a large veterinary hospital specialized on companion animals.

Example Entity-Relationship Model:

![E-R Model](Meds.png?raw=true "E-R Model")

    Change every file that requires it to your access credentials and upload them to your database
    Then run on the command line

    source begin.sql

    -> this initializes everything, including triggers and stuff
